# WiFip2p

An experimental app to connect multiple devices simultaneously and exchange messages using tcp sockets running Android 4.0+ enabled using WiFi Direct.

Users need to enable developer mode and install the app using USB mode. You can import the project on eclipse.

To enable "developer mode" for installation using eclipse. Goto 'Settings->About phone' and scroll down below to see "Build number". Tap on "Build Number" 5 times or more unless developer mode is visible.
Set "Developer Options" as below:
  1. USB debugging.
  2. Verify apps over USB.
  

Warning: This is an experimental application, use it on your own risk. You can log any reports, would be greatly helpful.

Thanks
